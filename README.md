Audio Classification Using Deep Learning

The purpose of this study is twofold.

1. Evaluate the model learning ability by characteristics that can be extracted from audio.
2. Accuracy and speed of each model of DNN, CNN, RNN and CRNNN were compared.

In conclusion,

we can see how important the MFCC is in speech recognition.

This is because both the speed and accuracy of the model are high.

No significant differences were found in CNN, RNN, CRNN in model comparison, which could not be trusted as physical GPU errors occurred frequently in the learning process of RNN and CRNN.
